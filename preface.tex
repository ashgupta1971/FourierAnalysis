\begin{chapter}{Preface}
This book is based on the class notes of a third year, undergraduate Fourier Analysis course offered by the Pure Math Department at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The course was taught by professor J. A. Baker during the winter term (January to April) 1994. The course (PMATH 353) is no longer available but its contents are offered under a different heading and course number.

A basic understanding of undergraduate calculus, real analysis and complex analysis are required to read this book. However, the first chapter reviews 
several theorems of real and complex analysis that are used extensively throughout
this book.

There were nine assignments handed out by professor J. A. Baker during this course. The questions of these assignments are included as examples in this book, along with my solutions to them.

There was no official textbook for this course. However, professor Baker highly
recommended the book \emph{Fourier Analysis} by \emph{T.W. K\"{o}rner}.
There is a companion text called \emph{Exercises in Fourier Analysis} also by the
same author.

Please report any errors or suggestions for improvement to me at the email address noted below. Thank you.
